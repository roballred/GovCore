### Patch Changes

- fbd5dc1: Ship compiled builds — retire source-first packaging (#71, closes #56).

  Every package published `main: ./src/index.ts`, which pushed core's build internals onto consumers: internal type deps leaked (a consumer needed `@types/bcryptjs` just to typecheck `@govcore/auth`, #56), every Next.js app had to list all 14 packages in `transpilePackages`, and non-Next/Node consumers couldn't consume the TS source at all.

  Each package now builds with **tsup** to ESM + `.d.ts` + sourcemaps in `dist/`, with `exports`/`main`/`types` pointing at the compiled output and `files` limited to what ships (`dist`, plus `migrations/` for schema and `base.css` for theme). Intra-package modules are bundled; `dependencies`/`peerDependencies` (the other `@govcore/*` packages, drizzle, react, …) stay external. Multi-entry packages keep their subpaths compiled — `@govcore/auth/password`, `@govcore/content/screens`, `@govcore/schema/migrate`; the `govcore-migrate` bin still resolves `../migrations` from `dist/`.

  Non-breaking: a consumer that keeps `transpilePackages` for these keeps working (transpiling already-compiled ESM is a no-op) — but no longer needs it, or any of core's internal `@types`. Proven by the canary (`examples/minimal-app`) now building with an empty `next.config`, and by a CI build step so both the canary and the smoke resolve the compiled `dist/` rather than source.

### Minor Changes

- ca7cadb: Phase 3 — route protection and identity.

  `@govcore/auth`: `createAuth` factory wrapping Auth.js (NextAuth v5) — injected
  OIDC providers + local credentials (bcrypt), the Drizzle adapter over
  `@govcore/schema`, the invite-based SSO provisioning guard, JWT/session callbacks
  that stamp the active org/role from the membership model, login/logout audit, and
  the resurrection-guard marker. Plus `hashPassword`/`verifyPassword`/`validatePassword`
  and an edge-safe `./logout-marker` subpath. GovEA's product-specific per-org
  policy (lockout/session-timeout/password-expiry) is intentionally not included.

  `@govcore/middleware`: edge-safe `createMiddleware` factory — read-only `getToken`
  decode (never writes cookies, ADR-0003), the #782 post-logout resurrection guard,
  the #807 bind-address-safe redirect, and configurable public/instance-only/
  maintenance gating, plus `defaultMatcher`.
