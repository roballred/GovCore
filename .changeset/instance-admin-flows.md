Operator-plane console mutations (#63). The org/user administration flows behind an instance console were rebuilt by every consumer (GovEA `actions/instance.ts`, GovCRM `lib/platform.ts`), and the user path is exactly where they diverged. Promote the mutations to core, composing the membership invariants from #65 so the guard and write-sync are identical everywhere.

`@govcore/tenancy` gains `createOrganization` (auto-slug via the new exported `slugify`; a duplicate slug returns a typed `slug-taken`), `renameOrganization` (name-only; audited before/after), and `updateUserAdministration` — the guard-heavy one: it enforces the last-active-admin invariant via `assertNotLastActiveAdmin` (inside the transaction) and an own-instance-admin lockout, updates the `users` row, and keeps the membership in lockstep via `upsertMembership`. All audited as `platform.org.*` / `platform.user.update` and generic over the app's admin role name; tenancy now depends on `@govcore/audit`.

`@govcore/auth` gains `provisionUser` — create a user with an initial password + primary membership. It lives here (not tenancy) because it hashes: validates against the policy, hashes, inserts, writes the membership through tenancy's `upsertMembership`, and audits `platform.user.create` without ever putting the password in the payload; a duplicate email returns a typed `email-taken`.

`@govcore/schema` gains `isUniqueViolation(err)` — a pure, edge-safe SQLSTATE-23505 predicate so operator flows turn a duplicate slug/email into a typed result instead of a 500.

All framework-agnostic (no FormData/redirect/revalidate — the consumer keeps the thin `'use server'` wrapper and the `instance_admin` gate) and returning typed results rather than throwing.
